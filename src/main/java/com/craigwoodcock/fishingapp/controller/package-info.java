/**
 * Root controller package for the Fishing Application that manages all HTTP request handling.
 *
 * <p>This package is organized into two main subpackages:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>apiController - Handles REST API endpoints returning JSON/XML responses</li>
 *   <li>webController - Handles web interface endpoints returning view templates</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Common functionality and base classes for both API and web controllers are placed
 * in this root package. The separation between API and web controllers allows for
 * clear distinction between REST API endpoints and traditional web page handlers.
